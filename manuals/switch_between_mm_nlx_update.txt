first step: while SDA is still here, ask which folder in the Impl --> current year (2022) --> current patient's name to use (usually it's the folder with the most excluded channels plus without micros)

the important point is keeping the current system running before the other one is completely ready to record

if going from mm to neuralynx
	-prepare pegasus for recording 
	-switch the Brausen
	-after that you can go on with the micromed side 
end

If micromed is open
	turn off recording (press 1. red 2. blue), close the program	
end

- click Montage (buttom right corner of the desktop)
- "Ordner Öffnen" --> Impl --> current year (2022) --> current patient's name
if switching to micromed
	-go to micromed (the one SDA mentioned or the one as decribed above with "micromed" in the name)
elseif switching to Neuralynx 
	-go to neuralynx (the one SDA mentioned or the one as decribed above with "neuralynx" in the name)
end
	
- copy the three files in the folder	
- paste in C:/System98/Setting

- start micromed program from desktop
- on top left: extra --> Systemeinstellung --> EEG (pw:micromed)
- Verstärker Einsetllungen

if going from NLX to mm
	-first in the buttom dropdown menu choose
		BQPCI Express
	-then in the upper dromdown menu choose 
		SD LTM128 Express
elseif going from mm to NLX
	-first in the buttom dropdown menu choose
		network
	-then in the upper dromdown menu choose 
		Digitalynx 256
		192.168.1.3
end

- beenden
- click on EEG button (middle top button in micromed gui)
- first the videocamera

if switching to micromed
	switch Brausen
end

- then the play button (blue triangle)
	if "ERSTE MENU" error: reset Brause 
- then the video doppelbild (the one with patient image, the left one)
- then recording (red button)
